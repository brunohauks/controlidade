# controlidade

This is a prototype that I created in order to understand more how React works. It is a simple web application to help stores keeping track of their inventory in terms of expiration date. The idea is to allow the user to add products to the inventory and show a dashboard of products to expire in a given period.

This prototype uses Spring Boot, ReactJs and Mysql. You will need to change the application.property to a valid database if you want to play around with this.
